  "landing_text": "<p>The Critters are a peace-loving, yet unknown colony living in the forest. Lately, a disease has caused some of them to turn into mutants disturbing the peace. Mutated Critters go on a rampage and stop obliging the colony's rules. Since the Critters are unable to distinguish mutants from healthy Critters, they need your help! On the way to a save tower, they behave according to certain rules the mutants ignore. They have developed a device that, when operated correctly, relocates the mutants to a save place until a cure has been found.</p><p>Help to save the peace by creating mines that test the Critter‘s properties. If a Critter passes the test, it will proceed to the tower. Increase your score by letting healthy Critters reach home and relocating mutated ones. Decrease your score by letting mutants reach the tower. To help you know the correct behaviour, you are given the rules according to which the Critters behave. Start with the <a href=\"/game?level=level_1\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #ffa600;\">first level</a> or select another <a href=\"/#level_display\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #ffa600;\">level</a>.</p>",
